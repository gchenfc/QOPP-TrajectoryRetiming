# QOPP-TrajectoryRetiming
Trajectory Retiming with Quadratic Objectives, for our ICRA2024 paper "Generalizing Trajectory Retiming to Quadratic Objective Functions"

For now, please refer to my [gtsam fork branch](https://github.com/gchenfc/gtsam/tree/features/gerry/trajectory_retiming/gtsam_unstable/retiming), but I eventually will split off the code into this separate repo to make clearer install & usage instructions.
